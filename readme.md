### Proof of Concept Implementation

The current implementation in the `script/` directory serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate core functionalities:

#### 1. PDF Processing (`pdf_load.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles PDF document processing and vectorization
- **Key Classes**:
  - `DocumentMetadata`: Stores document chunk metadata (filename, page number, chunk index)
  - `KnowledgeDoc`: Document schema with metadata and embeddings
- **Key Functions**:
  - `extract_and_chunk_pdfs()`: Intelligent text extraction and chunking
  - `vectorize_documents()`: Generates embeddings using SentenceTransformer
  - `clean_text()`: Text preprocessing and stopwords removal
- **Features**:
  - Intelligent chunking with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
  - Quality control for text chunks
  - Error handling for PDF processing
  - Metadata preservation

#### 2. RAG Pipeline (`rag_pipeline_script.py`)
- **Purpose**: Implements the main RAG pipeline for question generation and evaluation.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `ExamQuestion`: Structure for storing exam questions.
  - `RAGPipeline`: Main pipeline controller.
- **Key Features**:
  - JSON-based question storage and retrieval.
  - Enhanced context relevance scoring.
  - **Two-Round Semantic Search**:
    - **First Round**: Retrieves a broad set of knowledge content related to the topic to ensure a wide context for question generation.
    - **Second Round**: Refines the search results by selecting one context and performing a focused search to generate a specific question based on that content.
  - Question generation with GPT-4, ensuring questions are concise and directly answerable from the provided context.
  - Answer evaluation with detailed feedback, focusing on clarity and relevance.
- **Integration**: Connects PDF processing with the examination system, allowing for dynamic question generation based on course materials.

#### 3. Examination System (`rag/core.py`)
- **Status**: Conceptual framework demonstration
- **Current Scope**:
  - Basic exam context management
  - Simple question-answer flow
  - Preliminary feedback generation
- **Limitations**:
  - Limited dialogue management
  - Basic context awareness
  - Simple evaluation criteria

### Future Development Plans

The current proof of concept implementation will evolve into:

1. **Enhanced Processing**
   - Advanced PDF parsing with structure preservation
   - Sophisticated chunking strategies
   - Improved metadata extraction

2. **Robust Pipeline**
   - Advanced context retrieval algorithms
   - Dynamic question adaptation
   - Comprehensive evaluation system

3. **Interactive System**
   - Real-time dialogue management
   - Adaptive questioning strategies
   - Detailed performance analytics

4. **Question Tree Implementation**
   - **Overview**: Implement a pre-generated question tree structure that allows for dynamic question selection based on student responses during the examination.
   - **Design**:
     - **QuestionNode Class**: Create a class to represent each question and its potential follow-up questions.
     - **Tree Structure**: Each question can have multiple child questions, forming a hierarchical structure that allows for depth in questioning.
     - **Dynamic Selection**: Based on the student's answer, the system will select the next question from the tree, ensuring a tailored examination experience.
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Generate Question Tree**:
        - Create a method to generate a question tree for a given topic and difficulty level.
        - Each node in the tree will represent a question, with child nodes representing follow-up questions.
     2. **Select Next Question**:
        - Implement logic to evaluate the student's answer and select the appropriate next question from the tree.
        - Use keywords or response analysis to determine the direction of questioning.
     3. **Integrate with Existing System**:
        - Ensure the question tree integrates seamlessly with the existing RAG pipeline and evaluation system.
        - Maintain context and flow of the examination while allowing for dynamic adjustments based on student performance.

### Example Question Tree Structure

```python
class QuestionNode:
    def __init__(self, question: str, context: List[str], difficulty: int, topic: str):
        self.question = question
        self.context = context
        self.difficulty = difficulty
        self.topic = topic
        self.children = []  # Store follow-up questions

    def add_child(self, child_node: 'QuestionNode'):
        self.children.append(child_node)

def generate_question_tree(topic: str, difficulty: int, depth: int) -> QuestionNode:
    root_question = rag.generate_question(topic, difficulty)
    root_node = QuestionNode(root_question.question, root_question.context, difficulty, topic)

    if depth > 0:
        for _ in range(3):  # Assume each question has 3 follow-up questions
            child_question = rag.generate_question(topic, difficulty + 1)  # Gradually increasing difficulty
            child_node = QuestionNode(child_question.question, child_question.context, difficulty + 1, topic)
            root_node.add_child(child_node)
            # Recursively generate sub-questions
            child_node.children.extend(generate_question_tree(topic, difficulty + 1, depth - 1).children)

    return root_node
```
